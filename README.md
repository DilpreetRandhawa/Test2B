This web-based dinner reservation form allows users to input their name and phone number, select a preferred dinner time, and choose meal options via checkboxes.
The form includes real-time validation: the name must include both first and last names, and the phone number must be exactly six characters long and start with a digit.
Errors are shown directly below the inputs, and the submit button remains disabled until both fields are valid.
Upon successful submission, a confirmation message displays the user's name, phone number, and selected time, confirming the reservation. 
The layout is left-aligned for time and meal selection, ensuring a clean, user-friendly interface.
